Successful execution of a Free and Open Source Project Fund requires clear definition of roles and responsibilities among staff members. While organizational structure will vary across institutions, several key functions need to be covered throughout the program lifecycle, including OSPO management, finance and/or grants administration, institutional leadership, and communications/outreach.

Suggested roles and associated responsibilities:

* Program Director \- overall program oversight, budget approvals, final funding decisions, main point of contact for senior leadership and funders.  
* Program Manager \- day-to-day program operations including marketing and outreach, main point of contact/communication for reviewers, submitters, and awardees, meeting and event planning   
* Review Committee \- evaluate proposals, provide feedback  
* Financial Manager \- budget tracking, grant compliance, financial reporting

A “RACI” chart, short for Responsible / Accountable / Consulted / Informed, is an easy way to show who is doing what on a project. A sample RACI chart for FOSSProF is below:

| Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Program Manager Review Committee Financial Manager | Program Director | OSPO Advisors Funders Communications | Dean, Provost, VP (senior leadership for the OSPO’s broader organizational unit)  External affairs |
