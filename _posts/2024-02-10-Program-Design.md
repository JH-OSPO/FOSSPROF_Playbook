#### <a id="section1">[**Phase 1 \- Planning**](#top)</a>

The planning phase lays the groundwork for a successful project. During this phase, OSPO staff should establish the focus and goals of the program, determine success metrics, create a communications and outreach plan, and ensure all stakeholders are informed and prepared.

    <h3>Financial planning</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="activity-description">
    <p>Determine the overall budget for the program, including awards, OSPO staff time, travel (e.g. conference presentations), technology, event planning, and overhead. Determine the total amount available for FOSSProF awards and the financial structure of the program. Answer questions such as: What is the maximum amount of funding available to each applicant? What are the limitations on what will be funded (e.g. no tuition reimbursement)?</p>

    <h3>Program focus</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="activity-description">
    <p>What is the focus or theme of this iteration of FOSSProF? What is in and out of scope? Potential themes include: OS roles: creators, maintainers, contributors OS themes: security, sustainability, documentation, diversity, reproducibility, etc. Career stage: Early career students or postdocs vs senior researchers and teaching faculty</p>

    <h3>Goals and objectives <em>(specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound)</em></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="activity-description">
    <p>Identify the specific end goals of this iteration of FOSSProF. Consider: How will this funding help OS projects on campus? How will funded projects be able to define, increase, and measure the impact of FOSSProF funding; for example, by increasing adoption, building community, citation growth, etc. How will this iteration of FOSSProF advance the mission of the OSPO, the OSPO's broader organizational unit, the University, etc. How will the OSPO define and measure success? What questions will FOSSProF allow the OSPO to answer? What is the definition of success for the FOSSProF initiative?</p>

Hold retrospective meeting with OSPO staff and FOSSProF team. Collate metrics, analyze, and assess. Suggested metrics/questions to answer: Types of activities proposed in all submitted projects. Were resource gaps centered around specific activities? Did certain types of activities result in improved sustainability or additional impact? Funding amounts requested across all submitted projects. What was the range of funding requested? Where did most proposals fall across this range? Was there a connection between funding requested and resulting impact? Success rate of funded projects. To what extent did each project achieve the goals laid out in their proposals? Did the most "successful" projects have any common characteristics? What might it look like to target projects with these characteristics in a second funding round?  Common roadblocks or challenges. Were similar obstacles encountered across projects? How did different projects overcome obstacles? What can we learn from their experiences? Impact of FOSSProF funding on community engagement. For projects that wanted to use FOSSProF funding to improve engagement, what results did they see and how are they measuring/identifying that improvement?  Long-term sustainability of projects and/or FOSSProF-funded activities. Do projects feel FOSSProF funding improved their project's prospects for long-term sustainability? If so, how are they measuring that sentiment? Are there specific activities they would like to continue? What could the OSPO do to continue to support projects after the funding period?  Identify insights, conclusions.</p>

#### <a id="section5">[**Suggested Timeline**](#top)</a>

From initial planning through final evaluation, the full FOSSProF cycle fits well into a 24 month period, but can be condensed if needed. To ease student hiring, it is recommended to align the timeline with the academic calendar. It is important to allow sufficient time for each phase; a rushed process may not allow projects time to complete their goals and objectives or recover from unexpected roadblocks.

**Sample Schedule \- one iteration aligned to the academic calendar**
